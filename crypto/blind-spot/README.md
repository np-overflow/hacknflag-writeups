# Blind Spot

Fun fact: I got the idea for this challenge from a TV show called blind spot. Hence the name of this challenge.

If you look through the text file, you would notice that it's all garbage. However, the flag is hidden character by character in the file.

This means that the flag is the only english ascii character in the file.

Filter the characters out to find the flag.

## flag

`HNF{y0u_h4ve_a_g00d_eye}`
