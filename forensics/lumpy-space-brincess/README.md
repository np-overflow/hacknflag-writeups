# Lumpy Space Brincess

This challenge is about hiding data in the Least Significant Bit(lsb) of an image.

To solve this challenge, open the image in `stegsolve`.

Navigate to blue pane 0 and you will notice that it looks like plain cancer.

Under the analyze tab, choose data extract and check the box for blue pane 0 and save the file as a text file.

Upon opening the text file, you will see a lot of # characters.

Extract all non # chars to get the flag.

## flag

`HNF{0h_My_gL0b_I_aM_th3_M0St_s1gN1f1cANt_pr1nCE55!!}`
