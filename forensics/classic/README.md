This was pretty much a troll challenge.

The flag is in the middle, right after the chorus.

It will sound very weird but you just need to reverse the audio using audacity.

The flag will then be read out to you.

## flag

`HNF{a4udio_steg}`

I apologize that the flag sounded more like `HNF{4udio_steg}` and causing some confusion
